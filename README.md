#### ðŸ“œ Some history...

Though I'm now shifting to web development, I'm a long-time advisor guy. I help other people make decisions. Here are some of the ways I've done that, in reverse chronological order:

- Real estate broker: I help people figure where to live, how much to spend, and whether to sell. Decision-focused, not sales-focused.

- Real estate and small business transactional attorney: I read and wrote boring documents, made them make sense to regular people, and negotiated deals.

- Small business consultant: I helped people get out of their own way and increase profitability.

- Clerk to a Montana Supreme Court Justice: I literally wrote his opinions for him, so that's little beyond "advisory" I guess.

- Financial advisor: I assisted folks with investment decisions, again more decision-focused than sales-focused.
