I'm a long-time advisor guy. I help other people make decisions. Here are some of the ways I've done that:

- Real estate broker

- Real estate and small business transactional attorney

- Small business consultant

- Financial advisor

Now, I'm coding. The crossover from where I've been to where I'm headed is going to produce some fun opportunities.
